# Flatten

The goal of this project is that will flatten an array of arbitrarily nested arrays of integers into a flat array of integers. 

> e.g. [[1,2,[3]],4] -> [1,2,3,4]. 

The repository has two solutions:

* [One written in Golang](https://github.com/iver/flatten/tree/master/golang)
* [Second one written in Elixir](https://github.com/iver/flatten/tree/master/elixir)

Each one has its own README.md file with build and test instructions.

* Golang [README.md](https://github.com/iver/flatten/tree/master/golang/README.md)
* Elixir [README.md](https://github.com/iver/flatten/tree/master/elixir/README.md)
